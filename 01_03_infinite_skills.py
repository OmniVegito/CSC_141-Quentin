# I want to gain a lot of skills. If I had infinite skills,
# I would make my personal creations and bring them to life.
# I really want to make a music program because I've been pretty vested in it.
# I honestly would love to make a digital art program because I've been doing this for 3 years.
# And lastly I'll make a anime program because it would be about talking on the plot and story.
